/* The tracking table is constituted by 2^24 radix trees (each tree, and the
 * table itself, are allocated in a lazy way only when needed) tracking
 * clients that may have certain keys in their local, client side, cache.
 *
 * Keys are grouped into 2^24 slots, in a way similar to Redis Cluster hash
 * slots, however here the function we use is crc64, taking the least
 * significant 24 bits of the output.
 *
 * When a client enables tracking with "CLIENT TRACKING on", each key served to
 * the client is hashed to one of such slots, and Redis will remember what
 * client may have keys about such slot. Later, when a key in a given slot is
 * modified, all the clients that may have local copies of keys in that slot
 * will receive an invalidation message. There is no distinction of database
 * number: a single table is used.
 *
 * Clients will normally take frequently requested objects in memory, removing
 * them when invalidation messages are received. A strategy clients may use is
 * to just cache objects in a dictionary, associating to each cached object
 * some incremental epoch, or just a timestamp. When invalidation messages are
 * received clients may store, in a different table, the timestamp (or epoch)
 * of the invalidation of such given slot: later when accessing objects, the
 * eviction of stale objects may be performed in a lazy way by checking if the
 * cached object timestamp is older than the invalidation timestamp for such
 * objects.
 *
 * The output of the 24 bit hash function is very large (more than 16 million
 * possible slots), so clients that may want to use less resources may only
 * use the most significant bits instead of the full 24 bits. */
